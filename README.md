Habit Helper
============

A notification system to annoy you into keeping up good habits. Only works for a really specific definition of "works", so probably best you don't use it.

TODO
====

* Get preferences to save
* Preference to open on startup
* Check it doesn't leak memory all over the shop
* Get Cmd-Q working from the preferences page
* Stop dock icon appearing
* Create icon
* Make it look like it wasn't made by a developer, ie not awful
